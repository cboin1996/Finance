# Finance

This project uses an iOS front end application to gather expenses and income data in an SQL backend service.  A PHP script is used to communicate between the database and the front end.  I created a Python desktop client that does the data analysis and presents the data in bar graph format on my desktop.  The code creates 12 graphs, one for each month of the year, automatically including a column of data for each expense category created in the app.  This app was inspired so I could see how I spend so much money on food lol.
